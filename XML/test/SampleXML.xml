  <p><lb/><milestone type="paragraph"/><hi rend="6 lines">I</hi>n order that the <lb/>honourable deeds <lb/>and ventures accomplished <lb/>by arms, which took <lb/>place during the <lb/>wars between <name type="place">France</name> <lb/>and <name type="place">England</name>, might be aptly documented <cb n="B"/>and commended to lasting memory, so that <lb/>courageous men might follow such <lb/>examples to inspire them to good, it is my wish <lb/>to undertake to record this glorious history, <lb/>which will be divided into four parts. But <lb/>before I begin, I entreat the Saviour <lb/>of the whole world, who created all <pb n="1 v"/><cb n="A"/>things from nothing, that he may create <lb/>and instil in me such exceptional insight <lb/>and understanding that I may continue <lb/>and persevere with this book which I <lb/>have begun, in such a way that all those, men <lb/>and women, who read it, see it, or hear it read, <lb/>may take enjoyment and pleasure in it, <lb/>and that I may prove worthy of their esteem.</p>
  <p><lb/><milestone type="paragraph"/>It is said, and such is the case, that <lb/>each edifice is built and constructed one <lb/>stone after another, and all great rivers <lb/>are formed and created from different places <lb/>and from several sources. In like fashion, <lb/>the sciences are compiled and derived by <lb/>many learned men, for what one of them may be <lb/>ignorant of is known to another; yet there <lb/>is nothing that will not be known <lb/>sooner or later. Now to address the matter <lb/>that I have undertaken to commence, firstly, <lb/>by the grace of God and of the Blessed <lb/>Virgin Mary from whom proceed all succour <lb/>and advancement, I wish to base <lb/>myself on the true chronicles formerly <lb/>composed and collected by that venerable <lb/>and wise master <name type="person">Jean le Bel</name>, canon of <name type="institution">Saint <lb/>Lambert's</name> in <name type="place">Liege</name>, who applied himself <lb/>with the utmost care and diligence in <lb/>this matter, and continued with it for <lb/>his entire lifetime as accurately as he <lb/>could. It cost him a great deal to acquire <lb/>such material, but whatever expenses <lb/>he incurred did not matter, nor did he lament <lb/>them, for he was rich and powerful and so could <lb/>well take them on himself for, being as he <lb/>was a generous, honourable and courtly <lb/>man, he would gladly spend his own wealth. During <lb/>his lifetime he was also a beloved <lb/>and intimate friend of my most noble and redoubtable <lb/>lord <rs type="person">Sir Jean de Hainault</rs>, who is <lb/>rightly venerated in this book, for he was at <lb/>the head of many fine ventures and a <cb n="B"/>close companion of kings. For this reason, <lb/>the aforementioned master <name type="person">Jean le Bel</name> <lb/>could in his company witness and hear of <lb/>many exploits, which are contained in what <lb/>now follows.</p>
  <p><milestone type="paragraph"/>It is true that I, who have <lb/>taken on the composition of this book, <lb/>have been led to do so for the pleasure, to which <lb/>I have always been inclined, afforded by <lb/>spending time with many a great and <lb/>noble lord, whether in <name type="place">France</name>, <name type="place">England</name>, <name type="place">Scotland</name>, <lb/>or in various other countries, so becoming <lb/>acquainted with them. I have always <lb/>requested and enquired to the best of my <lb/>ability for true accounts of the wars <lb/>and exploits that have occurred, and in particular <lb/>since the great <rs type="event">battle of Poitiers</rs> at which <lb/>the noble <rs type="person">king Jean of France</rs> was captured. For <lb/>before that I was still young in both thinking <lb/>and years. Yet despite this I undertook <lb/>rather audaciously, having just left school, <lb/>to compose and chronicle in verse the <lb/>aforementioned wars, and to carry to <name type="place">England</name> the <lb/>completed book duly compiled, to present to <lb/>that most high and most gracious lady, lady <lb/><name type="person">Philippa of Hainault</name>, queen of England, who <lb/>received it most pleasantly and joyfully, <lb/>bringing me much profit.</p>
  <p><milestone type="paragraph"/>Now, it <lb/>may well be that this book has not been <lb/>researched or composed as meticulously as <lb/>such a subject demands, for deeds of arms, <lb/>which are so dearly bought, should <lb/>be justly attributed and credited to <lb/>those who accomplish them through valour. <lb/>Therefore, to acquit myself with all, <lb/>as is only right, I have undertaken to <lb/>continue with this history according to the <lb/>manner and foundation aforementioned, <lb/>at the request and entreaty of one of my <lb/>dear patrons and masters, my lord <name type="person">Robert <lb/>de Namur</name>, to whom I gladly owe my affection <lb/>and obedience, and may God grant me to do <pb n="2 r"/><cb n="A"/>as may be pleasing to him.</p>

To that end I will not omit, <lb/>forget, alter, or abridge anything at <lb/>all in this history for want of language, <lb/>but will rather enrich and <lb/>elaborate where I am able, and thoroughly <lb/>relate every event point by point  <lb/>from the birth of king Edward of <lb/>England who reigned and participated <lb/>in so many remarkable and perilous <lb/>ventures and battles, and other <lb/>feats of arms and great prowess since <lb/>the year of grace 1326 in which this noble <lb/>king was crowned in <name type="place">England</name>. All of those <lb/>who were with him in his battles <lb/>and most fortunate encounters, or <lb/>with his people when he was not present <lb/>in person, which you will subsequently <lb/>hear about, should rightly <lb/>be renowned for their valour; <lb/>notwithstanding that there are a good <lb/>many of them who may well be deemed <lb/>to have achieved the very pinnacle <lb/>of valour amongst their peers, <lb/>such as the person of the aforementioned <lb/>noble king, the prince of <cb n="B"/>Wales his son, the duke of Lancaster, <lb/><rs type="person">Sir Gauthier de Mauny</rs> of <name type="place">Hainault</name>, <rs type="person">Sir John Chandos</rs>, <rs type="person">Sir Franck de <lb/>Hale</rs>, and several others who will <lb/>be remembered in this book for their <lb/>integrity and skill. For in all the <lb/>battles in which they have taken part, they <lb/>have achieved renown as the best, <lb/>by land and sea, and have shown such <lb/>valour that they ought rightly <lb/>to be held up as valorous above <lb/>all other. Not that the others, let it be <lb/>said, who have served with them <lb/>should be considered less worthy.</p>
  <p><milestone type="paragraph"/><lb/>In <name type="place">France</name> there are also to be found <lb/>strong, robust and vigorous exemplars of <lb/>chivalry, for the realm of <name type="place">France</name> was <lb/>never brought so low that one might <lb/>not find those prepared to join in <lb/>combat. And the noble Valois king named <lb/>Philippe was a bold and chivalrous <lb/>knight, along with king Jean, his son, Charles, <lb/>king of Bohemia, the count of Alencon, <lb/>the <rs type="person">count of Foix</rs>, my lord Saintre, <rs type="person">Sir Arnoul <lb/>d'Audrehem</rs>, my lord <rs type="person">Boucicaut</rs>, <rs type="person">Sir Guichard <lb/>d'Angle</rs>, my lord <name type="person">Guichard de Beaujeu</name>, <lb/>father and son, and several others <lb/>whom I cannot all name at this <lb/>time and who will be honoured in <lb/>timely fashion, for in truth we must <lb/>recognise the courage of all those who have <lb/>been seen to do their rightful duty in <lb/>such cruel and treacherous battles <lb/>and stand their ground until defeat.</p>

  <lb/><head type="rubric">How king Edward was crowned in <name type="place">London</name>, <lb/>and concerning the opinions of the English.</head>
  <p><lb/><hi rend="3 lines">F</hi>irst, to probe deeper into <lb/>the subject of this <lb/>honourable and compelling history <lb/>of the noble king Edward of England, who <lb/>was crowned in London in the year of <lb/>grace 1326, on Christmas Day, during the <pb n="2 v"/><cb n="A"/>lifetime of the king, his father, and of <lb/>the queen, his mother. The widespread opinion <lb/>of the English is certainly such, <lb/>and has proved to be so in <name type="place">England</name> since <lb/>the time of noble king Arthur, that <lb/>between two valiant kings there is always <lb/>one less well endowed with insight and prowess. <lb/>This is apparent in the king Edward of <lb/>whom I was speaking just now, for true it <lb/>is that his ancestor, called the good <lb/>king Edward, was a courageous, wise and <lb/>bold man, enterprising and fortunate in <lb/>exploits of war. He had been much occupied <lb/>against the Scots and conquered them three <lb/>or four times, and the Scots could never <lb/>gain any lasting advantage or victory <lb/>over him. When he died, his son from his <lb/>first marriage, who was the father of fair <lb/>king Edward, succeeded him to the crown <lb/>yet did not remotely resemble him in <lb/>understanding or prowess, governing and <lb/>ruling haphazardly on account of <lb/>counsel given to him, for which he later <lb/>suffered terribly, as you will discover <lb/>hereafter if it please you. For, quite soon <lb/>after he had been crowned, <rs type="person">Robert Bruce</rs>, <lb/>king of Scotland, who had caused trouble <lb/>so often for the said good king Edward <lb/>who was known for his great prowess, <lb/>reconquered all <name type="place">Scotland</name> including the city of <lb/><name type="place">Berwick-upon-Tweed</name>. He twice burned and laid <lb/>waste to large areas of the kingdom of <name type="place">England</name> <lb/>four or five days' march into the <lb/>country. He defeated this king and all the barons <lb/>of <name type="place">England</name> at a place in <name type="place">Scotland</name> called <lb/><name type="place">Stirling</name>, in a decisive pitched battle. The <lb/>pursuit following this defeat lasted two <lb/>days and two nights, and the king fled to <lb/><name type="place">London</name> with a very few of his men; <lb/>but because this is no part of our matter I <lb/>will speak no more of it for the present.</p>

  <cb n="B"/><head type="rubric">For what reason the war was begun between <lb/>the king of France and the king of England.</head>
  <p><lb/><hi rend="3 lines">T</hi>he king who was the <lb/>father of this gallant king had <lb/>two half-brothers, one of whom was <lb/>the earl of Norfolk and known as the Earl <lb/>Marshal, who had a very wild and fierce <lb/>temperament, and the other was named my lord <lb/>Edmund, and was earl of Kent, and he was a noble, <lb/>mild and benevolent man, beloved of the <lb/>people. This king was married to the <lb/>daughter of good king Philippe the Fair, <lb/>king of France; she was one of the most beautiful <lb/>women in the world. By this lady he <lb/>had two sons and two daughters. The first <lb/>son is the noble and valiant king Edward of <lb/>England with whom this history begins; the <lb/>other was named <name type="person">John of Eltham</name>; he died <lb/>rather young. The eldest<ref target="Translation Footnotes.xml#e-I-4-1"/> of the two <lb/>daughters was called <name type="person">Isabella</name> and was wedded to young king Robert <lb/>Bruce; she was given to him in marriage in <lb/>their youth by agreement reached between <lb/>the two kings and realms of <name type="place">England</name> and <lb/><name type="place">Scotland</name> to bring about a peace. The other daughter <lb/>was married to <name type="person">Reginald, count of <lb/>Guelders</name>, who had two sons by this lady, <lb/><name type="person">Reinoud</name> and Edward, who later reigned <lb/>with great strength against their enemies.</p>
  <p><milestone n="1-3" ed="SHF" unit="chapter"/><lb/><hi rend="3 lines">N</hi>ow history shows us that good <lb/>king Philippe the Fair of France <lb/>had three sons as well as his fair <lb/>daughter <name type="person">Isabella</name>, who was married to the <lb/>king of England of whom I have already spoken <lb/>to you. These three sons were most <lb/>handsome, the eldest of whom was called <name type="person">Louis</name> <lb/>and who was, during his father's lifetime, <lb/>the king of Navarre and nicknamed <lb/>the Quarrelsome King. The second was named <lb/><name type="person">Philippe the Tall</name>, and the third, <name type="person">Charles</name>. <lb/>All three of them were kings of <name type="place">France</name> <lb/>following the death of their father, king Philippe, <pb n="3 r"/><cb n="A"/>by right of succession one after the other, <lb/>without producing a male heir of their <lb/>bodies through marriage. Soon after <lb/>the passing of the last of these kings, <lb/>Charles, the twelve peers and barons of <lb/><name type="place">France</name> did not grant the realm to the sister <lb/>who was queen of England, because they said <lb/>and maintained, and are still adamant, <lb/>that the kingdom of <name type="place">France</name> is so good and <lb/>noble that it must never pass to a female, <lb/>nor in consequence to the king of England, <lb/>her eldest son. For their view of the matter <lb/>is that a lady's son may not claim <lb/>the right of succession through his mother, <lb/>in such case as his mother has no right <lb/>herself. And so it was for these reasons <lb/>that the twelve peers and barons of <name type="place">France</name> <lb/>unanimously granted the kingdom of <name type="place">France</name> <lb/>to my lord Philippe, the eldest son of <lb/>my lord <name type="person">Charles of Valois</name>, late brother of the <lb/>aforementioned <rs type="person">Philippe the Fair</rs>, and as <lb/>such they cast aside the queen of England and her <lb/>eldest son, who was the male heir and son <lb/>of the sister of the last of those kings, <lb/>Charles. Thus did the said kingdom pass <lb/>out of the right line, so it appeared to many, <lb/>precipitating great wars and the <lb/>devastation of people and land in the <lb/>realm of <name type="place">France</name> and further afield, as you <lb/>will hear later on in my account. For it is <lb/>the true foundation of this history to <lb/>recount the grand endeavours and feats <lb/>of arms which have occurred, because <lb/>since the time of the good <name type="person">Charlemagne</name>, <lb/>king of <name type="place">France</name>, such great exploits <lb/>and wars as these have not been known <lb/>in the realm of <name type="place">France</name>, and you will <lb/>hear and read of them here, provided I have <lb/>the time and leisure to record them and <lb/>you to read them.</p>
  <p><milestone type="paragraph"/>Now I will return to <lb/>the principal thread of my account, leaving <cb n="B"/>aside these other matters until the time and place is <lb/>right for me to speak of them once more. </p>
